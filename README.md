# Embers Shader (URP ShaderGraph)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/NehxSOTWCBM) you will learn how to create a Fire/Embers Shader in ShaderGraph that does **not** require any textures or sprite sheets.

We do this with generated tri-mapped noise that scroll at different speeds and adjust the power of the secondary and teritary noises for more variation.
